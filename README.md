Representative sample set from and AFR run

Note AFR's levels are low becuse the car is running on E85

This run was lean for most of the map but it is a good representation of the tpye of
data sets one might get from a loggin run.

Logging was done with Innovate MotorSport LM2 Wideband O2 with the csv derived from the logworks software 
available for thier product.

csv file if raw data from the logger
afrs.dat is just the average AFR values in an X/Y array.
rpm_map_afr.dat are all the specs derived from the origional csv data set.
